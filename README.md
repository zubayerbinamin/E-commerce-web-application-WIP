# E-commerce-web-application (WIP)

Developed the backend of an E-commerce web application using Python, Django, and created APIs to make databases to store listings made by users as part of my projects in the Edx Harvard CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

# Quick start:

Open VS code and make sure to install Django with:

	pip3 install Django 

After opening the clock-in app in VS code, make sure your terminal shows ‘your-computer’/commerce/commerce. You can do this by typing the following in the terminal:

	cd commerce
 
Then type:

	python manage.py makemigrations
 
Then type:

	python manage.py migrate
 
Then run the server:

	Python manage.py runserver

 After registering, user can create postings, and see postings made by other users.
