# E-commerce-website (WIP)

# Quick start:

Open VS code and make sure to install Django with:

	pip3 install Django 

After opening the clock-in app in VS code, make sure your terminal shows ‘your-computer’/commerce/commerce. You can do this by typing the following in the terminal:

	cd commerce
 
Then type:

	python manage.py makemigrations
 
Then type:

	python manage.py migrate
 
Then run the server:

	Python manage.py runserver
